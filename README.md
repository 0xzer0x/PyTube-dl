# automation script for yt-dlp

A minimalistic simple python script that automates the basic functionality of the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) tool on windows/linux, all downloaded files can be found in the \Output directory

**NOTE: For windows users, ffmpeg must be in the same folder as the script** 

#### Requirements:

- Python 3.6+

- yt-dlp file which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest) (must be in the same directory as the script)

- ffmpeg
  - **For windows:** download from [here](https://www.n.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds), download the latest release (the essentials version works fine, no need for the full version), copy the ffmpeg.exe file from the \bin folder in the archive
  - **For linux:**
    `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or install using your distro's package manager

If you have any suggestions/modifications to improve the script, feel free to contact me.

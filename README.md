# PyTube-dl: automation script for yt-dlp

A minimalistic simple python script that automates the basic functionality of the [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) tool on windows, all downloaded files can be found in the \Output directory

**NOTE: All requirements must be in the same folder as the script** 

#### Requirements:

- yt-dlp.exe file which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest)

- ffmpeg.exe which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds), download the latest release (the essentials version works fine, no need for the full version), copy the ffmpeg.exe file from the \bin folder in the archive

If you have any suggestions/modifications to improve the script, feel free to contact me.
